Recipe type: Main Dish
Serves: 6

INGREDIENTS
½ lb. boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into small chunks
1 - 13.25 to 16 oz. box of linguini or fettuccini pasta, broken in half (I used whole wheat)
4 medium carrots, peeled and cut in thin 3 inch long strips
1 medium red bell pepper, cut in thin 3 inch long strips
1 bunch green onions, white part sliced and green part cut in 3 inch long strips
4 cloves garlic, minced
¼ cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon corn starch
1 tablespoon sugar
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil

INSTRUCTIONS
Add the chicken, then the pasta, then the remaining ingredients to a large stockpot and cover. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir and reduce the heat to medium-low.
Cook covered for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cook until most of the liquid is gone and the chicken is cooked through.
Remove the lid and let the dish rest for 5 minutes before serving.
