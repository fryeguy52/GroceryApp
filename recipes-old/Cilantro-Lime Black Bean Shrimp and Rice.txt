Ingredients

Shrimp
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
Rice
2 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
1/2 cup water
1 cup uncooked Jasmine rice (or use any rice that says on the package that it takes 15 minutes to cook it)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons lime juice, freshly squeezed + extra
1 can (15 oz) black beans, rinsed, drained  Coupons
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped + extra

Instructions

Shrimp
Heat large skillet until hot on medium heat. Add olive oil - it should run easily but not sizzle or burn. 
Add shrimp and minced garlic to the skillet, making sure it doesn't crowd, sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of salt 
and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes over shrimp. Cook shrimp, stirring once or twice, on medium heat, 
about 3-4 minutes total, until pink in color.

Remove shrimp from the skillet to a plate.

Rice
To the same (now empty) skillet, add chicken broth, water, uncooked rice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to boil. 
Mix everything well. Reduce the heat to low boil simmer. Cover the skillet with the lid. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, 
covered, until the rice is cooked through.
Mix in the lime juice, rinsed and drained black beans, and fresh cilantro into the cooked rice.
Add extra lime juice (about 1 tablespoon) and extra chopped fresh cilantro to the plate with shrimp, 
mix to coat shrimp with lime juice and cilantro. Add the shrimp to the skillet with rice and gently reheat.
