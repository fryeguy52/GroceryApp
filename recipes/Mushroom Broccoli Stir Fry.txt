##Recipe

STIR FRY SAUCE
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 Tbsp chili garlic sauce
1 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp water
1 tsp cornstarch

STIR FRY
7 oz wide rice noodles
1 Tbsp cooking oil
8 oz sliced white mushrooms
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 lb frozen broccoli florets
2 green onions, sliced

- In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, brown sugar, water, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set the sauce aside.
- Cook the noodles according to the package directions, then drain in a colander. 
- While the noodles are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the cooking oil, sliced mushrooms, and minced garlic. Sauté until the mushrooms release all their moisture and begin to brown on the edges.
- Add the broccoli florets (still frozen) and sauté until they are no longer frozen but still bright green.
- Finally, add the noodles and the prepared sauce. Stir and cook, still over medium heat, for 1-2 minutes more or until everything is cooked through and the sauce has thickened and no longer pools on the bottom of the skillet. Top with sliced green onions and serve.
