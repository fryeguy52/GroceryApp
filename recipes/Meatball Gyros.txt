##recipe
Ingredients
===========

- 1 pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)
- 1 lemon
- .25 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- .5 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- 1 (18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces
- .5 teaspoon honey
- Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving

Preparation
============

1. Trim and halve the brussels sprouts.
1. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 2 teaspoons chopped zest.)
1. In a large (preferably 12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high.
1. Add the brussels sprouts, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then
arrange the brussels sprouts in an even layer, cut-side down. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook,
undisturbed, until the brussels sprouts are well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Add the red-pepper flakes,
stir and cook until the brussels sprouts are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.
1. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Break up any gnocchi that are stuck
together, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes.
1. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is
golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes.
1. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through.
1. Serve with grated Parmesan.
