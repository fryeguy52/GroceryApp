##recipe

4 Roma tomatoes
3 zucchini
2 bell pepper
1.5 pounds broccoli crowns
2 sweet potatoes
1 red onion
6 cloves garlic
2 Tbsp olive oil 
2 boxes couscous
5 cups vegetable broth
0.25 bunch parsley

INSTRUCTIONS
- Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash and chop the tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, broccoli, sweet potato, and red onion into 1 to 1.5-inch pieces. Peel and mince garlic.
- Toss the chopped vegetables and garlic with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Spread them out on a baking sheet so they are in a single layer. Sprinkle a couple pinches of salt and pepper over the vegetables
- Place the vegetables in the oven and roast at 400ºF for about 45 minutes, stirring twice throughout, until the vegetables are wilted and browned on the edges.
- While the vegetables are roasting, cook the couscous. Add the vegetable broth to a sauce pot, place a lid on top, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the couscous, turn off the heat, and cover the pot with the lid once again. Let the couscous sit, undisturbed, for ten minutes. Then, fluff with a fork.
- Combine the couscous, roasted vegetables, and parsley in a bowl, and stir to combine. Season with more salt and pepper if desired. Serve warm or cold.
