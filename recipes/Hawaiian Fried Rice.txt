##Recipe
Ingredients
============

- 4 Tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 Tablespoon sesame seed oil
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- 1/2 Tablespoon vegetable oil divided
- 2 cups diced ham
- 1 red bell pepper seeded and diced
- 2 green onions diced, white and green parts separated
- 3 garlic cloves minced
- 5 cups cooked rice white or brown, cold
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup pineapple pieces

Instructions
=============

In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, sesame oil and hot sauce. Set aside.
In a large, non-stick skillet, heat 1/2 of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced ham, red bell pepper and the chopped white parts of the green onions. Cook and stir for 5 to 7 minutes, or until ham is browned and bell pepper is crisp-tender. Stir in the garlic and cook another minute. Pour this mixture into a bowl, and set aside.
Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the same skillet until hot, and then add the cold rice. Cook and stir rice, breaking up the clumps. Cook until rice is thoroughly heated, about 8 minutes.
Push the rice to one side of the skillet. Crack the eggs onto the other side of skillet and stir until lightly scrambled and set. Stir the eggs and the ham mixture into the rice. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the rice and cook, stirring until combined and hot.
Turn off the heat, stir in the pineapple and green parts of the onions. Serve!
