6 green onions
1 Tbsp neutral cooking oil
1 lb. lean ground beef
4 cloves garlic
2 Tbsp fresh grated ginger
6 cups rice

INSTRUCTIONS
- Set rice to cook in IP.
- In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, sriracha, and brown sugar. Set the sauce aside.
- Remove cabbage core and finely shred the leaves. Slice green onions. Mince four cloves of garlic. Peel a knob of ginger using either a vegetable peeler or by scraping with the side of a spoon, then grate it using a small-holed cheese grater.
- Heat edamame and potstickers.
- Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot add the cooking oil, ground beef, garlic, ginger, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the beef until browned (about five minutes).
- Add the cabbage and carrots to the skillet and continue to stir and cook until the cabbage is slightly wilted (or fully wilted, if you prefer). Stir in the prepared sauce and the green onions. Top with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and a drizzle of sriracha, then serve over rice.
