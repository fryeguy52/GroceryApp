## recipe
Ingredients
1 (12- to 16-ounce) loaf artisan bread (8 to 10 very full cups)
2 to 3 large heirloom tomatoes (3 pounds, about 8 cups chopped)
1/2 large cucumber
1 medium red or yellow bell pepper
1/2 medium red onion
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pepper, to taste
1/2 cup thinly sliced basil
Equipment
Chef's knife
Cutting board
Mixing bowl
Jam jar, or a small bowl and whisk

Instructions
1. Slice the bread into 1-inch cubes: Slice or tear the bread into roughly 1-inch cubes.
I usually leave the crusts on, but you can remove them if you prefer.
You should have about 10 overflowing cups of bread.

2. Dry the bread: Spread the bread cubes over a baking sheet.
Leave uncovered overnight to stale and harden. Alternatively,
bake in a 300Â°F oven until hardened on the outside but still slightly soft in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes,
stirring once or twice during baking.

3. Chop the vegetables: Chop the tomatoes, cucumber, and bell pepper into bite-sized pieces.
Slice the onion into thin slices and soak in a bowl of cold water for 10 to 15 minutes while assembling the rest of the salad.

4. Make the vinaigrette: Combine the olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and a few grinds of fresh pepper in a jam jar.
Shake vigorously. Alternatively, combine ingredients in a small bowl and whisk to combine.

5. Combine the salad in a bowl: Combine the bread and chopped vegetables in a large mixing bowl.
Pour the vinaigrette over top and use a spatula to thoroughly combine.

6. Let the salad sit for 1/2 hour to 4 hours: Let the salad sit at least half an hour before serving, or up to 4 hours.
Stir occasionally so the juices and vinaigrette are evenly distributed.

7. Add basil and serve: Just before serving, stir in the basil.
This salad is best eaten the day it's made.
