Drain the excess liquid from the can of diced tomatoes.
Combine the diced tomatoes in a bowl with the garlic, olive oil, oregano, salt, freshly cracked pepper, and lemon juice.

Lay the fish fillets over the tomato mixture, then spoon the rest of the tomatoes over top, completely covering the fish.

Serve hot, with a sprinkle of chopped fresh parsley on top.
