##Ingredients
1, box, dry fettuccine
2, pounds, frozen broccoli florets
2, clove, garlic
4, Tbsp, butter
4, Tbsp, all-purpose flour
3, cups, milk
1, cup, grated parmesan
0.125, tsp, nutmeg

##Recipe
16 oz. dry fettuccine
32 oz. frozen broccoli florets
2 clove garlic
4 Tbsp butter
4 Tbsp all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
1 cup grated parmesan
1/8 tsp nutmeg

Instructions:
- Begin to boil a large pot of water to cook the pasta. When it reaches a full boil, add the pasta and cook for 10-12 minutes or until al dente. When the pasta is finished cooking, reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water and then drain the pasta in a colander.  
- While the pasta is cooking, thaw the broccoli in the microwave and begin to make the parmesan sauce. Mince the garlic and cook it over medium heat in a medium sauce pot with the butter until the garlic has softened slightly (3-5 minutes). Add the flour, stir and cook for 2-3 minutes more. This is the “roux” that will thicken the sauce.  
- Whisk in the milk. Increase the heat to medium-high. Whisk the milk mixture until it comes up to a light simmer. As soon as it reaches a simmer it will thicken and should be able to coat a wooden spoon (see photos below). Turn the heat off and whisk in the parmesan cheese. Add nutmeg, plus cracked black pepper and salt to taste.   
- Return the cooked pasta to the large pot that it was boiled in (with the burner turned off). Add the reserved pasta cooking water and toss the pasta to loosen it up. Add the thawed broccoli and then pour the parmesan sauce over top. Stir to coat everything in the sauce and then serve.
