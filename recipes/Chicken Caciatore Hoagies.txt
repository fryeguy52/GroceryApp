1 ¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground pepper, divided
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano, plus more for garnish
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
⅓ cup dry red wine
1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
6 eaches whole-wheat hoagie rolls, split and toasted
¾ cup shredded Romano cheese

Directions
Step 1
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the chicken and cook, turning once or twice, until browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.
Transfer to a plate.

Step 2
Add bell pepper and onion to the pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir in garlic, oregano and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until most of the wine is reduced, about 1 minute.
Add tomatoes and the chicken. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Step 3
Remove from heat. Using two forks, shred the chicken into large pieces.
Divide the chicken mixture among hoagie rolls and top with cheese and more oregano, if desired.
