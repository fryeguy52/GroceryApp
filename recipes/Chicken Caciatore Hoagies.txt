1 ¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
0.5 teaspoon salt
0.25 teaspoon ground pepper, divided
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano, plus more for garnish
0.25 teaspoon crushed red pepper
0.5 cup dry red wine
1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
6 hoagie rolls, split and toasted
0.75 cup shredded Romano cheese
fresh fruit

Directions
- Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high heat, turning once or twice, until browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
- Add bell pepper and onion to the pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes.
- Stir in garlic, oregano and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
- Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until most of the wine is reduced, about 1 minute.
- Add tomatoes and the chicken. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 15 minutes.
- Remove from heat. Using two forks, shred the chicken into large pieces.
- Divide the chicken mixture among hoagie rolls and top with cheese and more oregano, if desired. Serve with fresh fruit.
