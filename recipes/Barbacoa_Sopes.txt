##Recipe
 Sopes
 ---

- Mix Masa harina and warm water in a medium-size bowl and knead until you have a uniform texture.
If the dough feels dry, add more water, little by little, spoon by spoon, until the dough is soft and manageable, like play dough.
It doesn’t have to be sticky. If you live in a place with lots of humidity, the dough won’t need too much water.
If that's not your case, make sure the dough has enough moisture to avoid any cracking on the sope's surfaces.
- Now, cover the dough with a wet kitchen towel; this will help to keep the dough moist.
Always keep a small bowl of water next to your working area to keep your hands and the dough moist.
- Divide the dough into 10 pieces of the same size, cover with the kitchen towel.
- Heat the griddle to medium-high heat.
- To form the sopes, cut the plastic bag into 2 squares of about 6-IN each.
Place one piece of plastic on the Tortilla press, then put down one of the small balls of dough and cover with the other piece of plastic,
close the tortillera and press down gently with the tortilla press handle until you form a medium size thick tortilla. of about 4-1/2 inches.
Lift the handle and remove the top plastic. Pick up the tortilla, holding with the plastic at the bottom, gently flip the tortilla to unto the palm of your hand.
A large part of the tortilla will cover your hand.
If you don’t have a Tortilla Press, use a glass pie dish to press down the dough;
I use it all the time and it works wonderfully.
- Place the tortilla on the already hot griddle/comal, this is a fast but gentle move.
- Turn the tortilla after a minute, don’t let it cook longer or the dough will dry and crack.
- Turn again after a minute, and the last cooking will take about 20-30 seconds. Remove from the griddle with the help of a spatula.
- Cover the tortillas with a dry kitchen towel and allow to cool for about 30-45 seconds, and start forming the border pinching the edges with your fingers.
- Now, the tortillas had become sopes, cover again with the kitchen towel and keep cooking the rest of the sopes.

TO SERVE THE SOPES:

- Heat the oil or lard in a skillet or griddle at medium heat. Place the sopes on the skillet and lightly fry them on both sides
(about 30 seconds each side will be enough time to fry them and give them a little golden color).
- Remove from the heat and place on a plate that has already being covered with paper towels to absorb any excess fat.
- Now is time to spread the refried beans, top with shredded lettuce, beef, chicken, or any other topping of your choice.
- Serve with salsa.

Beans
---

- Heat the oil or lard in a frying pan over a medium-low heat.
- Start frying the onions until they are transparent and start to brown.
- Add the beans and mash down using a potato masher until they become a paste.
Blend to a smooth puree and then add them to the frying pan where the onions are being browned.
- They will become a thick puree, keep scrapping from the edges and bottom of the pan. If you prefer to add a little more oil, this is the time.
- Tilt the frying pan sideways and form a roll with the bean paste. I like to flip them like pancakes a little bit.
- Taste to check if it needs salt.

Rice
---

- Place rice in a colander and rinse until the water comes out clear. If you don’t rinse it, the rice grains will stick together.
Once rinsed, place in a bowl and cover with water. Let it rest for 15 minutes. After this time, drain excess water from rice. This step will render fluffy rice.
- Using Saute mode, heat oil over medium heat. Add the drained rice and fry, stirring from time to time.
Besides adding extra flavor, frying the rice also help the grains from sticking together. This step will take about 7 minutes. The rice will get a very light golden color.
- While the rice is frying, dissolve the 6 Knorr Chicken tomato bouillon, garlic, and onion powder in 6 cups of hot water, to form a uniform mix.
- Add the above water mixture to the rice, and stir. Add in piece of the green pepper.
- Set instant pot ot manual for 10 minutes. Release pressure onece time is up

 Barbacoa
---
- Remove the meat from the package and rinse it, then dry it using paper towels. Cut it into two or three pieces, depending on the size of the cooking pot you're using; the parts should be more or less the same size so they can cook evenly.
- Place the meat pieces, bones, onion, garlic, bay leaf, and avocado leaves (if using) in a large cooking pot. Cover with water and cook until the meat is very tender and you can easily shred it. If using a regular stock pot to cook on the stove, the meat will be ready in about two and half hours. In the slow cooker, it will take 8 hours in the low setting and 6 hours in the high setting. It will take 50 minutes in a pressure cooker, or 40 minutes in an Instant Pot.
- While the meat is cooking, lightly toast the peppers for a few seconds on the griddle, then place them in a saucepan with hot water and let them soak for 20-30 minutes until they're very soft.
- Drain the peppers and place them in your blender with the two garlic cloves, oregano, and 1 cup of the cooking broth (or clean water). Process until you have a smooth sauce.
- Remove the cooked meat from the pot. Discard any fat and shred the meat.
- Heat the oil in a large frying pan and pour the sauce in. Fry the sauce for a few minutes, then stir in the shredded meat. Let it cook for about 5-8 minutes to allow all the flavors to combine. Season the stew with salt and pepper.
- Serve with warm corn or flour tortillas, chopped onion and cilantro, and green salsa. You can serve it with raw or cooked green salsa.
