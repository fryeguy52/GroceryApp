##ingredients
1, pound, uncooked whole wheat pasta
3, tablespoons, butter
1, teaspoon, salt
2.5, cups, shredded cheddar cheese
1, cup, whole milk
1, package, frozen peas

##recipe
1 pound uncooked whole wheat pasta
4 cups water
3 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup whole milk
frozen peas


- Put the pasta, water, butter, and salt into the Instant Pot. Cook for 4 minutes using the manual function. 
- Heat peas in microwave or on stove.
- You can release the steam in two ways: 1) Quick release the steam using the valve on top immediately after the timer goes off (note: this can cause some butter to spray out, so be prepared with a towel); or 2) Do natural release for 10 minutes – there will still be a little bit of steam, but it will avoid the butter spray. When it’s done, the noodles should have a thin layer of starchy, buttery sauce on them.
- Gently stir in the cheese and milk. Add more seasoning or liquid as necessary.
