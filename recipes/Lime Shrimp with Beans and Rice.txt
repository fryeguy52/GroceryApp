Cilantro-Lime Black Bean Shrimp and Rice

Ingredients

Shrimp
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
Rice
2 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
1/2 cup water
1 cup uncooked Jasmine rice (or use any rice that says on the package that it takes 15 minutes to cook it)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons lime juice, freshly squeezed + extra
1 can (15 oz) black beans, rinsed, drained  Coupons
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped + extra
Salad mix
1 tomato
1 cucumber

Instructions

Shrimp
Heat large skillet until hot on medium heat. Add olive oil - it should run easily but not sizzle or burn. 
Add shrimp and minced garlic to the skillet, making sure it doesn't crowd, sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of salt 
and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes over shrimp. Cook shrimp, stirring once or twice, on medium heat, 
about 3-4 minutes total, until pink in color.

Remove shrimp from the skillet to a plate.

Rice
To the same (now empty) skillet, add chicken broth, water, uncooked rice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to boil. 
Mix everything well. Reduce the heat to low boil simmer. Cover the skillet with the lid. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, 
covered, until the rice is cooked through.
Mix in the lime juice, rinsed and drained black beans, and fresh cilantro into the cooked rice.
Add extra lime juice (about 1 tablespoon) and extra chopped fresh cilantro to the plate with shrimp, 
mix to coat shrimp with lime juice and cilantro. Add the shrimp to the skillet with rice and gently reheat.

Serve with side salad.
