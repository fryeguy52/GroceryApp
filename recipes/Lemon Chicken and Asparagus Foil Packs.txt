Lemon Chicken & Asparagus Foil Packs

Ingredients
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded to even thickness, OR 6-8 boneless skinless chicken thighs (see note)
1 large bundle of asparagus spears (about 1 pound)
1 lemons, divided
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1½ teaspoons Italian seasoning
salt and pepper to taste

Instructions
Lay four 12x12 inch squares of foil out on a flat surface. Place one chicken breasts
(or 1-2 thighs) in the middle of each piece of foil.

Trim the flat end of the asparagus at 1-2 inches from the end and discard. Cut the
remaining spears in half and divided them between the foil packs.

Thinly slice one of the lemons and divide the slices between the foil packs,
tucking the slices in, around, and between the chicken and asparagus.

Stir together butter, garlic, juice of the remaining lemon, and Italian seasoning.
Brush over chicken and asparagus. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.

Fold the foil over the chicken and asparagus to close off the pack, pinch the
ends together so the pack stays closed.

Grill over medium-high heat for 7-9 minutes on each side OR bake at 400 for 15-20
minutes or until chicken is cooked through and asparagus is tender. Serve immediately.
