1.5, cups, guacamole
1, cup, sour cream
0.5, tsp, Taco Seasoning Mix
1, cup, Cheese Mexican Blend
1, cup, tomatoes
0.5, cup, green onions
0.5, cup, black olives
8, , flour tortillas
1, tsp, olive oil

## Recipe

1 can (16 oz.) refried pinto beans (or use homemade refried
beans)
1 1/2 cups guacamole (purchased or homemade guacamole)
1 cup light sour cream
1/2 tsp. Kalyn’s Taco Seasoning Mix (or use your favorite Taco Seasoning)
1 cup finely grated low-fat cheese such as Four Cheese Mexican Blend
 (or more if you like a lot of cheese)
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions
1/2 cup sliced black olives (or use a 4 oz. can sliced olives)
6-8 low-carb flour tortillas, 6 or 8 inch inch size
(I like Mission Carb Balance Low-Carb Tortillas)
olive oil for greasing baking sheet, about 1 tsp.
Place a baking sheet inside the oven or toaster oven and let it get hot
while you preheat oven to 450F/230C, about 10 minutes.

Carefully remove baking sheet, drizzle a tiny bit of olive oil on it and
spread around with a paper towel, and put flour tortillas on the baking sheet.

Toast tortillas in the oven until they’re crisp and barely starting to brown,
turning several times.  This will take less than 5 minutes so watch them
carefully.

While tortillas are crisping, put the refried beans in a bowl, stir to break
them apart, and microwave 2-3 minutes, or until they’re hot.  Stir the Taco
Seasoning Mix into the sour cream.  Chop the onions, slice green onions, and
slice the olives.  (If you’re using homemade guacamole and cheese that needs
to be grated you’ll need to prepare those as well.)

Put crisped tortilla shell on a plate and top with:
–a thin layer of refried beans (1-2 tablespoons)
–a thin layer of guacamole (1-2 tablespoons)
–a thin layer of seasoned sour cream (1-2 tablespoons)
–several generous pinches of finely grated low-fat cheese
–chopped tomatoes
–thinly sliced green onions
–sliced olives

Serve right away, with salsa or hot sauce if desired.  You can keep the
topping ingredients in the fridge and crisp more tortillas later to use
any leftovers.
