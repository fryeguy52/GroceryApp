##recipe
Ingredients
===========

- 1 cup yellow masarepa (precooked cornmeal; see Tip)
- 1 cup warm water
- 0.5 teaspoon salt, divided
- 4 tablespoons corn oil, divided
- 1 large poblano, diced
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 0.25 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added black beans, rinsed
- 1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
- 0.25 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish
- 2 tablespoons lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving
- 0.25 cup crumbled cotija cheese or queso fresco

Directions
===========

1. Combine masarepa, water and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Stir until a smooth dough forms. Set aside.

1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in beans and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro and lime juice.

1. Meanwhile, divide the dough into 4 balls and press into disks 4 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 of the arepas and cook, turning once, until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes total. Repeat with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and dough.

1. Top the arepas with some of the bean mixture and cheese. Garnish with more cilantro and serve with lime wedges, if desired.

Tips
=========

Tip: Masarepa, precooked cornmeal, can be found in well-stocked grocery stores. Don't swap in masa harina (used to make tortillas). It won't give the same light texture.
