##ingredients
1, medium, onion
3, cloves, garlic
1, bag, baby carrots
2, cups, sliced mushrooms
2, cups, brown rice
1, tablespoon, olive oil
2.25, cups, chicken broth
2, pounds, chicken thighs
1, can, cream of mushroom soup (reduced sodium)
2, tablespoons, worchestershire sauce
1, tablespoon, fresh thyme

##recipe
1 medium onion
3 clove garlic
2 cups baby carrots
2 cups sliced mushrooms
2 cups brown rice (uncooked)
1 tablespoon olive oil
2.25 cup chicken broth, low-sodium
2 pounds chicken thigh, boneless, skinless
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper, ground
1 can (10.75 oz) soup, cream of chicken, canned, condensed
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon fresh thyme


- Push "saute" button on Instant Pot. While it heats, dice onion, mince garlic, and chop veggies. Rinse and drain rice.
- When pot says "HOT," add oil to pot and saute onions for 3 minutes. Then press "cancel" to turn the saute setting off.
- Mix veggies, garlic, rice, and broth into the pot. Place chicken on top, salt and pepper, then cover with cream of chicken soup (homemade is preferable) and Worchestershire sauce. Place 8-10 small sprigs of thyme on top. NOTE: chicken breasts also work well, just make sure to cut them in half so they're not too thick.
- Seal the Instant Pot, close the vent, and press "manual." Use the "pressure" button to toggle to high pressure.  For brown rice: set the time for 25 minutes.  For white rice: set the timer for 20 minutes.  After 10 seconds the pot should register that it has begun the pressurizing process.
- Once the pot is done cooking, do quick release.
- Remove thyme sprigs (keeping leaves when possible). Stir pot to shred chicken and mix in any extra liquid. Serve warm.
