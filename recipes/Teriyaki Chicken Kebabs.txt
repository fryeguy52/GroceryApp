##Recipe

1 inch fresh ginger, grated
1/4 cup	soy sauce
1 cup water
1 clove	fresh garlic, minced
3 Tbsp	brown sugar
1/2 tsp	sesame oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 large	bell peppers
1 medium red onion
1 medium fresh pineapple
rice


- In a bowl, combine the soy sauce with one cup water, garlic, brown sugar, sesame oil, and ginger. This is your teriyaki marinade.
- Cube the chicken and put in a large glass dish with the marinade. Keep the marinating chicken covered and in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. If you are using wooden/bamboo skewers, soak them in water for one hour.
- Cook rice in rice cooker / Instant Pot.
- Chop the bell peppers and onion into squares. Cut the pineapple into long spears.
- Build the kabobs on the skewers, making sure to alternate the chicken, bell peppers and onions. Place the kabobs on the grill first. Close the lid to the grill to make sure the radiant heat cooks the chicken all the way through. Periodically turn the kabobs so all sides get grill marks.
- When the kabobs have grill marks on all sides, move them to the outside (where it is cooler) and grill the pineapple in the center. Again, turn the pineapple to make grill marks on all sides.
